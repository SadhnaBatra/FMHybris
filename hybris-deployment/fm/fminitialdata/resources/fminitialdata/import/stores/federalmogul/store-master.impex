# ImpEx for Importing Store Master configuration

# This impex contains master data for all stores. Right now the file contains
# master data for only 2 stores. This file will be updated as we get more data.
# The total number of stores for which we will have master data is expected to 
# be in the low 20's to start with. If the data size grows huge, then we will
# consider writing a job to load the store master data or do hot-folder configuration.
